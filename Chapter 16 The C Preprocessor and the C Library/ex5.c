/* C Primer Plus. Programming Exercise 16.5
 * Write a function that takes as arguments the name of an array of type int elements, the
 * size of an array, and a value representing the number of picks. The function then should
 * select the indicated number of items at random from the array and prints them. No
 * array element is to be picked more than once. (This simulates picking lottery numbers or
 * jury members.) Also, if your implementation has time() (discussed in Chapter 12) or a
 * similar function available, use its output with srand() to initialize the rand() random-
 * number generator. Write a simple program that tests the function.
