/* C Primer Plus. Programming Exercise 7.11
 * The ABC Mail Order Grocery sells artichokes for $2.05 per pound, beets for $1.15 per
 * pound, and carrots for $1.09 per pound. It gives a 5% discount for orders of $100 or
 * more prior to adding shipping costs. It charges $6.50 shipping and handling for any
 * order of 5 pounds or under, $14.00 shipping and handling for orders over 5 pounds
 * and under 20 pounds, and $14.00 plus $0.50 per pound for shipments of 20 pounds or
 * more. Write a program that uses a switch statement in a loop such that a response of a
 * lets the user enter the pounds of artichokes desired, b the pounds of beets, c the pounds
 * of carrots, and q allows the user to exit the ordering process. The program should keep
 * track of cumulative totals. That is, if the user enters 4 pounds of beets and later enters
 * 5 pounds of beets, the program should use report 9 pounds of beets. The program then
 * should compute the total charges, the discount, if any, the shipping charges, and the
 * grand total. The program then should display all the purchase information: the cost per
 * pound, the pounds ordered, and the cost for that order for each vegetable, the total cost
 * of the order, the discount (if there is one), the shipping charge, and the grand total of all
 * the charges.
