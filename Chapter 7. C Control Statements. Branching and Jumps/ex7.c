/* C Primer Plus. Programming Exercise 7.7
 * Write a program that requests the hours worked in a week and then prints the gross pay,
 * the taxes, and the net pay. Assume the following:
 * a. Basic pay rate = $10.00/hr
 * b. Overtime (in excess of 40 hours) = time and a half
 * c. Tax rate: #15% of the first $300
 * 20% of the next $150
 * 25% of the rest
 * Use #define constants, and donâ€™t worry if the example does not conform to current
 * tax law.
