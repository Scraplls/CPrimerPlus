/* C Primer Plus. Programming Exercise 6.14
 * Write a program that creates two eight-element arrays of doubles and uses a loop to let
 * the user enter values for the eight elements of the first array. Have the program set the
 * elements of the second array to the cumulative totals of the elements of the first array.
 * For example, the fourth element of the second array should equal the sum of the first
 * four elements of the first array, and the fifth element of the second array should equal
 * the sum of the first five elements of the first array. (Itâ€™s possible to do this with nested
 * loops, but by using the fact that the fifth element of the second array equals the fourth
 * element of the second array plus the fifth element of the first array, you can avoid
 * nesting and just use a single loop for this task.) Finally, use loops to display the contents
 * of the two arrays, with the first array displayed on one line and with each element of the
 * second array displayed below the corresponding element of the first array.
