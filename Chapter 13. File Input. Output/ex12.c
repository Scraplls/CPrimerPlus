/* C Primer Plus. Programming Exercise 13.12
 * Create a text file consisting of 20 rows of 30 integers. The integers should be in the range
 * 0â€“9 and be separated by spaces. The file is a digital representation of a picture, with
 * the values 0 through 9 representing increasing levels of darkness. Write a program that
 * reads the contents of the file into a 20-by-30 array of ints. In a crude approach toward
 * converting this digital representation to a picture, have the program use the values
 * in this array to initialize a 20-by-31 array of chars, with a 0 value corresponding to a
 * space character, a 1 value to the period character, and so on, with each larger number
 * represented by a character that occupies more space. For example, you might use # to
 * represent 9. The last character (the 31st) in each row should be a null character, making
 * it an array of 20 strings. Have the program display the resulting picture (that is, print the
 * strings) and also store the result in a text file.
