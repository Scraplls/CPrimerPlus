/* C Primer Plus. Programming Exercise 17.7
 * Write a program that opens and reads a text file and records how many times each word
 * occurs in the file. Use a binary search tree modified to store both a word and the number
 * of times it occurs. After the program has read the file, it should offer a menu with three
 * choices. The first is to list all the words along with the number of occurrences. The
 * second is to let you enter a word, with the program reporting how many times the word
 * occurred in the file. The third choice is to quit.
